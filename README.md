# Agentic AI Portfolio Manager - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Name  
**Agentic AI Portfolio Manager**

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to build an automated, **agent-based portfolio management system** that can analyze equities, generate investment recommendations, manage risk, and optionally execute trades on a paper trading account (e.g., Interactive Brokers). The system uses **CrewAI** to coordinate multiple intelligent agents acting like a research analyst, risk manager, and trader â€” working together to make portfolio decisions more efficient and scalable.

## Core Features

| Agent                | Role Description                                                                                  | MVP Status               |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Research Agent (TechPod)** | Focuses on technology sector stocks (FAANG: AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, META). Analyzes recent developments and trends to generate actionable insights. | Implemented for MVP       |
| **Risk Agent**         | Evaluates portfolio risk metrics such as volatility, exposure, and drawdown to manage potential losses. | Planned for future phases |
| **Trader Agent**       | Places trades based on agent recommendations, interfacing with Interactive Brokers paper trading API. | Planned for future phases |
